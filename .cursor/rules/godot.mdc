## Core Development Guidelines

- Use strict typing in GDScript for better error detection and IDE support
- Implement \_ready() and other lifecycle functions with explicit super() calls
- Use @onready annotations instead of direct node references in \_ready()
- Prefer composition over inheritance where possible
- Use signals for loose coupling between nodes
- Follow Godot's node naming conventions (PascalCase for nodes, snake_case for methods)

## Code Style

- Use type hints for all variables and function parameters
- Document complex functions with docstrings
- Keep methods focused and under 30 lines when possible
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Group related properties and methods together

## Naming Conventions

- Files: Use snake_case for all filenames (e.g., player_character.gd, main_menu.tscn)
- Classes: Use PascalCase for custom class names with class_name (e.g., PlayerCharacter)
- Variables: Use snake_case for all variables including member variables (e.g., health_points)
- Constants: Use ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE for constants (e.g., MAX_HEALTH)
- Functions: Use snake_case for all functions including lifecycle functions (e.g., move_player())
- Enums: Use PascalCase for enum type names and ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE for enum values
- Nodes: Use PascalCase for node names in the scene tree (e.g., PlayerCharacter, MainCamera)
- Signals: Use snake_case in past tense to name events (e.g., health_depleted, enemy_defeated)

## Scene Organization

- Keep scene tree depth minimal for better performance
- Use scene inheritance for reusable components
- Implement proper scene cleanup on queue_free()
- Use SubViewport nodes carefully due to performance impact
- Provide step-by-step instructions to create Godot scene(s) instead of providing scene source code

## Signal Best Practices

- Use clear, contextual signal names that describe their purpose (e.g., player_health_changed)
- Utilize typed signals to improve safety and IDE assistance (e.g., signal item_collected(item_name: String))
- Connect signals in code for dynamic nodes, and in the editor for static relationships
- Avoid overusing signals - reserve them for important events, not frequent updates
- Pass only necessary data through signal arguments, avoiding entire node references when possible
- Use an autoload "EventBus" singleton for global signals that need to reach distant nodes
- Minimize signal bubbling through multiple parent nodes
- Always disconnect signals when nodes are freed to prevent memory leaks
- Document signals with comments explaining their purpose and parameters

## Resource Management

- Implement proper resource cleanup in \_exit_tree()
- Use preload() for essential resources, load() for optional ones
- Consider PackedByteArray storage impact on backwards compatibility
- Implement resource unloading for unused assets

## Performance Best Practices

- Use node groups judiciously for managing collections, and prefer direct node references for frequent, specific access to individual nodes.
- Implement object pooling for frequently spawned objects
- Use physics layers to optimize collision detection
- Prefer packed arrays (PackedVector2Array, etc.) over regular arrays

## Error Handling

- Implement graceful fallbacks for missing resources
- Use assert() for development-time error checking
- Log errors appropriately in production builds
- Handle network errors gracefully in multiplayer games

## TileMap Implementation

- TileMap node is deprecated - use multiple TileMapLayer nodes instead
- Convert existing TileMaps using the TileMap bottom panel toolbox option "Extract TileMap layers"
- Access TileMap layers through TileMapLayer nodes
- Update navigation code to use TileMapLayer.get_navigation_map()
- Store layer-specific properties on individual TileMapLayer nodes

## Editing .tscn files

- Cursor can edit existing `.tscn` scene files, but it will not create new scenes from scratch. When possible, make scene changes inside the Godot editor so node references, resource IDs, and scene metadata remain correct.
- Recommended workflow to modify a scene:
  - Open the project in Godot and edit the scene using the editor.
  - Save the scene (the `.tscn` file) from Godot.
  - Commit the updated `.tscn` file to version control.
- While `.tscn` files are plain text and can be edited by hand, manual edits are error-prone. If you edit a `.tscn` directly, always re-open and validate the scene in Godot afterward.
- For programmatic or repeatable scene changes, prefer editing GDScript, using scene templates, or writing import/export scripts rather than directly mutating `.tscn` content.
- If you want Cursor's assistance with a scene change, provide either the GDScript change you want applied, or a minimal, explicit textual diff for the `.tscn` plus a note that you'll validate the scene in Godot after the edit.
- When editing `.tscn` files, format and structure them according to Godot's official `.tscn` specification and examples. See the format reference here:

  `https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.4/contributing/development/file_formats/tscn.html`

  This reference shows the expected section order, resource and subresource syntax, node entries, animation and track formats, and example scenes. Follow those conventions so Godot can reliably parse and load the edited `.tscn` files.

## Automatic Testing Workflow

- After making any edits to GDScript files (`.gd`), scene files (`.tscn`), or project configuration, automatically test the project using MCP tools:
  1. Run the project using `mcp_godot_run_project` with the project path `/Users/beaumont_maxence/ce-christmas-2025`
  2. Wait a few seconds for the project to initialize
  3. Check for errors using `mcp_godot_get_debug_output` to retrieve any runtime errors or warnings
  4. If no errors are detected in the debug output, stop the project using `mcp_godot_stop_project`
  5. If errors are detected, report them to the user and keep the project running for debugging
- This testing should happen automatically after each code edit to ensure the project remains functional
- Only test after completing a logical set of changes, not after every single file save to avoid excessive testing
